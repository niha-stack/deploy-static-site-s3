# deploy-static-site-s3
Explored AWS S3 static website hosting by publicly deploying a static asset (image) with proper bucket policy and access control.


# Objective
This project demonstrates how to use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to publicly host a static image using S3's static website hosting feature. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with basic AWS services, understand bucket configuration, and learn how static content is served over the internet through cloud infrastructure.
